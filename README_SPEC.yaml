project_name: "cef-readme-spec-engine"
one_sentence_value_prop: "Deterministic spec-to-artifact README generator and validator driven by explicit requirements."
audience:
  include:
    - "Repo maintainers who want README quality tied to explicit specs."
    - "Agents or scripts that need deterministic README generation."
  exclude:
    - "Teams looking for marketing copy generation."
    - "Repos that want enforcement baked into the generator."
problem_statement: "README quality is often treated as subjective, making governance inconsistent and hard to audit. Without explicit structure, intent, and constraints, README changes drift and enforcement becomes ad hoc."
solution_summary: "cef-readme-spec-engine converts explicit specs plus repo metadata into a deterministic README artifact and validates it against declared structure, audience, and constraints; enforcement and policy decisions live elsewhere. Workflow baseline snapshot: ai_workflow_revisions/rev_001_current (local)."
outcomes:
  - "Generate README.md deterministically from README_SPEC.yaml."
  - "Validate README.md against declared structure, audience, and constraints."
  - "Produce a semantic diff between current and regenerated README."
  - "Keep README rules inspectable in YAML."
quick_start:
  - "python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate"
  - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
  - "python src/generate_readme.py --spec README_SPEC.yaml --output README.md"
  - "python src/validate_readme.py --spec README_SPEC.yaml --readme README.md"
  - "python src/diff_readme.py --spec README_SPEC.yaml --readme README.md"
